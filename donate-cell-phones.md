We're reaching out to ask for your help in making a real difference in the
lives of people at the Tithandizane Community Trust in Zambia, where we
volunteer. We regularly visit to continue our work, and we're always looking to
bring much-needed technology with us.

The community now has access to StarLink internet service, providing speeds of
200Mbps. We're looking to get smartphones into the hands of community members
who work and volunteer at the Trust. Having access to these devices could be
life-changing, enabling better communication, access to information, and even
the possibility of online work through platforms like Mechanical Turk. For many
in the community who currently make around $20 a month, this opportunity could
substantially increase their income and improve their lives.

If you have any old, unlocked smartphones that you're no longer using, please
consider donating them to this cause. It doesn't matter how old they are, as
long as they're functional and unlocked. Your donation could help bridge the
digital divide and provide access to opportunities that were previously out of
reach.

To donate a phone, please reach out to us directly via email at <a
href="mailto:tikondanefdn@gmail.com">tikondanefdn@gmail.com</a>. We'll be happy
to arrange a time to collect the phone from you or provide an address where you
can mail it.

If you don't have a phone to donate but still want to support this cause, you
can help by spreading the word to your friends, family, and colleagues who
might have old smartphones they're willing to give.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering this request.
Your generosity could truly change lives.
